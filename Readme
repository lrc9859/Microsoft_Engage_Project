IMPORTANT POINTS

HOW THE USERS CAN CHAT BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER THE MEETING?

The Users can chat before the meeting and after the meeting in the Team chat rooms.
The Users can chat during the meeting in the chat box in the side bar of the video call functionality page.

In the video calling feature there's no TURN server so the user's are able to only connect on the same network. 
It was clearly mentioned in the AMA-2 session held on 23rd June that this is an acceptable working prototype.
